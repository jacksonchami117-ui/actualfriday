### 2. Configure Secrets and Variables

Add the following secrets in your repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

#### Required Secrets:
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - Generate at [SonarCloud Security](https://sonarcloud.io/account/security)
- `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` - Format: `owner_repository` (e.g., `jacksonchami117-ui_actualfriday`)

#### Optional Secrets:
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Only needed for private repositories ([Codecov Settings](https://codecov.io))
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - Generate at [Snyk Account Settings](https://app.snyk.io/account)

### 3. Update Configuration

After installation, update the following files with your specific values:

#### SonarCloud Configuration (`sonar-project.properties`):
```properties
sonar.projectKey=your-org_your-repo
sonar.organization=your-org
```

#### Security Contact (`SECURITY.md`):
Replace `[SECURITY_EMAIL_PLACEHOLDER]` with your security contact email.

### 4. Enable Branch Protection

The Settings app will automatically configure branch protection rules when installed. The configuration includes:

- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- ‚úÖ Require status checks: `build`, `coverage`, `sonar`, `trivy`
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚úÖ Auto-delete head branches after merge
- ‚úÖ Squash merge only

## üîÑ Automated Workflows

### Continuous Integration
- **Build**: Runs tests, linting, and builds for Node.js/Python projects
- **Coverage**: Generates and reports test coverage to Codecov
- **SonarCloud**: Performs code quality and security analysis
- **Trivy**: Scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies and containers
- **Snyk**: Additional security scanning (optional)

### Automation
- **Renovate**: Updates dependencies automatically on weekends
- **Mergify**: Auto-merges approved PRs that pass all checks
- **Release Drafter**: Generates release notes based on PR labels
- **Labeler**: Auto-labels PRs based on changed files

### Quality Gates
All PRs must pass:
- ‚úÖ Build and tests
- ‚úÖ Code coverage thresholds (80% project, 70% patch)
- ‚úÖ SonarCloud quality gate
- ‚úÖ Security scans (Trivy)
- ‚úÖ At least 1 review approval

## üìù Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
3. **Create a pull request** - it will be automatically labeled
4. **Wait for CI** - all checks must pass
5. **Get review approval** - at least 1 approval required
6. **Auto-merge** - Mergify will automatically merge when conditions are met

## üè∑Ô∏è PR Labels

The following labels are automatically applied based on changed files:

- `documentation` - README, docs, markdown files
- `tests` - Test files and specs
- `ci` - GitHub Actions, workflows, CI configuration
- `dependencies` - Package files, lock files
- `config` - Configuration files
- `frontend` - JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML
- `backend` - Python, Java, Go, etc.
- `docker` - Dockerfile, docker-compose
